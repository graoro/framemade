# frameMade Vite Project (prepared)

This archive contains a ready-to-run Vite + React + TypeScript project built from the components you uploaded.
It attempts to sanitize package imports (removing inline `@version` suffixes) and provides placeholder assets for any Figma-embedded images.

## Quick start (locally)
1. Unzip this folder and `cd` into it:
   ```bash
   cd frameMade_vite_project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (This may take a little while; many packages are set to `*` to install latest versions.)

3. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The production-ready static output will be in `dist/`.

## Deploying to InfinityFree (static hosting)
InfinityFree supports static files only. To test there:
1. Run `npm run build` locally.
2. Upload the entire contents of the `dist/` folder to your InfinityFree account (usually via FTP or file manager).
3. Make sure `index.html` is at the root of your uploaded folder.

## Deploying to Vercel / Netlify
For Vercel and Netlify you can directly connect the repository (or drag & drop the project folder on Netlify):
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish / output directory: `dist`

Notes:
- I sanitized imports like `package@1.2.3` â†’ `package`. If you see runtime errors about missing or incompatible packages, install the correct package and version.
- One or two figma assets were substituted with placeholder images located at `/public/assets/`.
